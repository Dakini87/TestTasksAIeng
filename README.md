# XARlabs AI Engineer Interview Tasks

This repository contains my solutions to the technical tasks provided by XARlabs as part of the AI Engineer interview process. Each task focuses on core aspects of computer vision, real-time algorithm development, and model adaptation using publicly available medical or 3D datasets.

All tasks were developed as **proof-of-concept prototypes** in **Google Colab**, leveraging open-source models and libraries. The scripts included in this repo mirror the logic implemented in the Colab notebooks.

## Task Summaries & Colab Links

### Task 1: Vessel Segmentation with a Pretrained Model
- **Objective**: Use and improve a pretrained model (e.g., U-Net) for vascular structure segmentation in CTA/MRA scans.
- **Key Features**: Fine-tuning, post-processing, and performance evaluation (e.g., Dice coefficient).

### Task 3: Object Recognition in Surgical Video
- **Objective**: Detect surgical instruments (e.g., scalpel) in real video frames.
- **Key Features**: Object detection using pretrained models (YOLO/SSD), frame annotation, and runtime discussion.
